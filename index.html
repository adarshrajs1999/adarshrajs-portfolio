      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is devoted to spreading the teachings of Lord Krishna.
        Central to ISKCON's philosophy is the divine love story of Radha and Krishna, symbolizing the purest devotion and spiritual bliss.

      <h2>The Story of Radha and Krishna</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshipped as the embodiment of divine love, joy, and wisdom.
        Radha, his eternal consort, represents the pure soul seeking union with the divine.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to scriptures, Radha and Krishna's relationship transcends worldly love. Their rasa lila (divine dance) depicts the soul’s eternal longing and blissful communion with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their story teaches the essence of bhakti — loving devotion — which ISKCON followers cherish through prayer, chanting, and community.

        Temples worldwide celebrate their divine pastimes with music, dance, and scripture study, inspiring spiritual growth.
